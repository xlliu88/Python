Normal distribution:
    nice mathemetical proporties
        can be completely characterized by: mean & SD
        mean & SD can be used to caculate confidence interval.
    many natrually accorring examples
    
    Empirical rule
        68% of data within 1 sd of mean
        95% of data within 2 sd of mean
        99.7% in 3 sd of mean
        
    standard error (SE): estimate of standard deviation
        if P = % sampled, n = sample size
        SE = (p*(1-p)/n)**0.5
